Sum of Values Less Than or Equal to X 
A set of N positive integers are passed as the input.
Another number X which may or may not be present in these N integers is also passed as the input.
The program must print the sum of the values (in the N integers) which are less than or equal to X).
Boundary Condition(s):3 <= N <= 20
Input Format:The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N numbers.
The third line contains the value of X.
Output Format:The first line contains the sum of the values.
Example Input/Output 1:Input:510 5 12 35 2112
Output:27
Example Input/Output 2:99 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 8190
Output:582
